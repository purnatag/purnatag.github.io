### Teaching Philosophy  
While completing my course credits, I mainly took courses pertaining to theoretical computer science. While I do feel that might have been limiting in some sense, it also allowed me sufficient time to take in theorems that, at first glance, seemed intimidating. I prefer absorbing new concepts through considerable amount of reflection and practice, and I noticed I was not alone in this. When I was a fresher at IIT Madras, I had to quickly get comfortable with mathematical rigour that is necessary to understand theoretical CS courses.

So I enjoyed being a TA for the same courses later, where I could guide fresh grad students who had the same problems as I did, to at least see why the subject matter was exciting. Irrespective of whether I made any visible difference, I learnt a lot about inter-personal skills in the process and became better at explaining concepts.

Following are the lists of courses I was a TA for.
