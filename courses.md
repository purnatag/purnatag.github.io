While completing my course credits, I mainly took courses pertaining to theoretical computer science. While I do feel tha might have been limiting in some sense, it also allowed me to take in theorems that, at first glance, seemed intimidating. I tend to take time adapting to new concepts, and I noticed I was not alone in this. So I enjoyed being a TA for the same courses later, where I could guide slow-learners like me to at least see why the subject matter was exciting. I cannot vouch I made any visible difference, however I learnt a lot about inter-personal skills in the process and became better at explaining concepts.
Following are the lists of courses I was a TA for, and the list of courses I took.
