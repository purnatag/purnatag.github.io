#### Some topics in complexity theory I am currently looking into.

I am an early-career researcher, and therefore I am eager to explore the realm of computational complexity. My PhD thesis was on _Algebraic Complexity Theory_, a study of polynomials and computational problems on polynomials. Polynomials can be used to model common mathematical problems (as an easy example, adding two integers can be represented by _x+y_ where _x_ and _y_ can be substituted by any two integers we like). A question we like to ask in _Algebraic Complexity Theory_ is how hard a mathematical problem can a given collection of polynomials represent?

Studying the above question has given algebraic complexity theorists a very good view of how _powerful_ certain _kinds_ of polynomials are and the difference in _power_ between any two collections (or _classes_) of polynomials. However, recent advances have shown that other than the well-established methods of obtaining solutions to these questions, a study of the symmetries of polynomials can also be immensely useful. This is the field of _Geometric Complexity Theory_, which I find extremely interesting, though I am still learning about it.

I was also interested, after my PhD thesis submission, to look into objects other than polynomials. I want to learn more about Boolean functions, functions that take binary strings as input, and output a single bit. They are used to model decision problems (for example, is the majority of 3 bits 1 or 0 ?). _Analysis of boolean functions_ is an excellent toolset to understand boolean functions, and currently I am interested in knowing more about them.

### Topics Explored during PhD

* Parameterized Complexity - I studied the various parameterized complexity classes as defined in the Parameterized Complexity textbook by Flum and Grohe. With my advisor, we studied the Hypergraph Dualization problem with various restrictions.

* Fourier Expansion of Boolean functionsand Derandomization - We looked at results that used properties of the Fourier spectrum of small classes of boolean functions to construct Pseudorandom Generators for those classes.

* Algebraic Complexity Theory - We explored both lower bound and PIT results. We were able to add to the existing lower bound results on multilinear models. We also studied parameterized versions of both lower bound and PIT problems.
