title: About Me
---

I work in computational complexity theory and just completed my PhD from IIT Madras, India. My PhD supervisor was [B. V. Raghavendra Rao](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~bvrr/) and I was a part of the vibrant [Algorithms and Complexity Theory group](http://theory.cse.iitm.ac.in/) there.
